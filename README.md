# Vaccination Insights: Covid-19 Vaccination Dashboard Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of Covid-19 vaccination data. Using Power BI, I created a dashboard to visualize trends, coverage rates, and regional distributions of vaccinations worldwide. The goal is to provide insights into the progress of vaccination efforts and identify gaps in coverage.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For building the interactive dashboard.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning and preparation.
- **DAX**: To create calculated fields for dynamic insights.

## Key Insights
- **Vaccination Trends**: The global vaccination rate saw a steady increase during the initial phases, with a sharp rise after vaccines became widely available.
- **Regional Insights**: Countries in Europe and North America had the highest vaccination coverage, while some countries in Africa and Asia lagged behind due to accessibility issues.
- **Age Group Analysis**: The elderly and high-risk individuals were prioritized, leading to higher coverage rates among these groups.
- **Vaccination Effectiveness**: Analysis of data shows a correlation between higher vaccination rates and reduced infection and death rates.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The data was obtained from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations), a trusted source for Covid-19-related statistics.
- **Size**: The dataset includes daily updates from various countries, spanning several months of vaccination efforts.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- **Global Vaccination Coverage**: A map visualizing vaccination rates by country.
- **Vaccination by Age Groups**: A bar chart showing coverage among different age demographics.
- **Daily Vaccinations**: A line chart displaying vaccination trends over time.
- **Vaccine Manufacturer Comparison**: A chart comparing different vaccines' distribution and effectiveness.

## How to Use
1. Open the provided Power BI (.pbix) file.
2. Explore the dashboard by interacting with the filters and charts to gain insights into vaccination efforts globally and regionally.

## Conclusion
This analysis helps understand the global effort to vaccinate populations against Covid-19. The dashboard provides crucial insights into where efforts have been successful and where more attention is needed to ensure global safety.
